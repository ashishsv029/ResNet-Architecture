# ResNet-Architecture
ResNet-50 is a deep residual network. The 50 refers to the number of layers it has. Itâ€™s a subclass of convolutional neural networks, with ResNet most popularly used for image classification.  The main innovation of ResNet is the skip connection,i.e a residual block is simply when the activation of a layer is fast-forwarded to a deeper layer in the neural network
